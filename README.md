<h1>Conduct a Security Audit</h1>
 
<h2>‚úçüèøDescription</h2>
I meticulously scrutinized the scope, goals, and minutiae of the risk assessment report, with a specific emphasis on assets presently overseen by the IT department. Additionally, I gave due attention to the salient points encapsulated in the "Additional Comments" section of the Risk Assessment. This analysis took into account not only the information furnished within the given scenario, but also drew from the broader context of the scope, goals, and risk assessment report, as well as pertinent details gleaned from supplementary documents referenced within the checklist. Following this thorough review, I executed an internal audit, meticulously working through a controls and compliance checklist.
