<h1>Conduct a Security Audit</h1>
<h2>‚úçüèøPart 1</h2>
<b>Scope and goals of the audit</b>
</br> </br>
Administrative/Managerial controls address the human component of cybersecurity. These controls include policies and procedures that define how an organization manages data and clearly defines employee responsibilities, including their role in protecting the organization. While administrative controls are typically policy based, the enforcement of those policies may require the use of technical or physical controls.
</br> </br>
Technical controls consist of solutions such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention systems (IPS), antivirus (AV) products, encryption, etc. Technical controls can be used in a number of ways to meet organizational goals and objectives.
</br> </br>
Physical/Operational controls include door locks, cabinet locks, surveillance cameras, badge readers, etc. They are used to limit physical access to physical assets by unauthorized personnel.

- <b>On-premises equipment for in-office business needs  /b>

<h2>‚úçüèøPart 2</h2>
<b></b>Scope and goals of the audit</b>
Scope: The scope is defined as the entire security program at Botium Toys. This means all assets need to be assessed alongside internal processes and procedures related to the implementation of controls and compliance best practices.
Goals: Assess existing assets and complete the controls and compliance checklist to determine which controls and compliance best practices need to be implemented to  improve Botium Toys‚Äô security posture.
<br>
<h2>Compliance checklist </h2>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
I meticulously scrutinized the scope, goals, and minutiae of the risk assessment report, with a specific emphasis on assets presently overseen by the IT department. Additionally, I gave due attention to the salient points encapsulated in the "Additional Comments" section of the Risk Assessment. This analysis took into account not only the information furnished within the given scenario, but also drew from the broader context of the scope, goals, and risk assessment report, as well as pertinent details gleaned from supplementary documents referenced within the checklist. Following this thorough review, I executed an internal audit, meticulously working through a controls and compliance checklist.
